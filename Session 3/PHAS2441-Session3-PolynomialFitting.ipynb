    "## Why fit to a polynomial?\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics we often meet an experimental relation between variables which is difficult to describe mathematically. This may either be because the theoretical equation which describes the observed behaviour is difficult to solve, or because the situation is complicated by several ill-defined factors and it is difficult to derive any theoretical equation which can describe it properly. However, we can still measure the dependence between the variables experimentally and we would like to have some means of predicting this dependence. In this kind of situation it is convenient to fit an equation to our experimental data. We can then use the fitted equation to interpolate, i.e. to calculate the expected value of a variable between our measured data points, and to extrapolate, i.e. to calculate the expected value beyond the range of our measured data points. This procedure is often called “parameterizing” the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle we could use any form of equation to fit a set of measured data, but if we have no theoretical basis for fitting a particular type of curve it is often simplest and easiest to fit a polynomial. The order of the polynomial and the coefficients of each term in the fitted equation are called the “parameters” of our fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we will look at how to fit polynomials with numpy, using experiment E5 as an example. If you are taking PHAS2441 you will be doing this experiment yourself in the second half of term. The experiment involves calibrating a temperature sensor by measuring its output voltage over a range of temperature. A polynomial equation is then fitted to the experimental results and this calibration equation is later input into a programmable chip so that the sensor can operate as a digital thermometer."

In advanced methods the full matrix is used, but at the undergraduate level some simplified approximation should be employed, such as taking just the covariance of the zero order coefficient.\n",

If the fitted line passes exactly through one of the data points the residual for this point is zero. We can see intuitively that if we have a \"good\" fit the residual values will be small. However, we have to remember that our experimental data points are subject to random errors and so we should expect the values of the residuals to be randomly distributed about zero. If we find that all the residuals are exactly zero we should start to suspect that our line is \"over-fitted\". This means it fits our initial data exactly, but if we take any more measurements (subject of course to the same random errors) the line will not fit them and therefore cannot be used to predict their values in advance.
